# MID Dataset Clustering


# Downloading the Datasset

* Download the Dyadic MID v4.01 dataset from [here](https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/mids/).
* Unzip the data in the data directory with `unzip dyadic_mid_4.01.zip`.
* Download the Country Codes file from [here](https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/cow-country-codes-2/) and add to the data directory.

On linux, the following sequence of commands should do the job.

```bash
cd data
wget https://correlatesofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/dyadic_mid_4.01.zip
unzip dyadic_mid_4.01.zip
wget https://correlatesofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/COW-country-codes.csv
cd ..
```
